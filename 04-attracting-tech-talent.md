# Building a Top Tech Team in the EU

Often-heard complaints about software engineers are that they:
- lack initiative
- focus on things that do not make the company money
- miss the bigger picture

The ideal engineer, however:
- understands what you care about intuitively
- does not waste time
- knows when to build something quick and when to build something well

Unfortunately for you, there are endless opportunities for these profiles. 
To understand how to find them and

To understand where to find enterprising engineers it's informative to take their perspective. 
You're a capable engineer born in the EU and you want to be rewarded for your talent. What do you do?
1. Move to the US. Realistically most would-be engineers in EU do not flock to the US
1. Start a business or join a high-tech startup
1. Go contracting


How to attract tech talent if you're not FAANG? --> you pay top dollar or you settle for less-than-stellar talent

It may seem impossible to build a top-notch tech team in the EU. 

1. you want bleeding edge tech, most of which comes from the US. Where do you find engineers that somehow have had exposure to the latest and greatest?
1. US tech salaries are crazy. How do you compete with that?
1. where are all the enterprising engineers?


There are key differences between the US and EU:
1. there is much more startup activity in the US, part of which can be attributed to a better tax and funding climate
1. because of stellar growth in the tech sector over the past two decades, software engineering salaries have reached record highs

The succesful tech startups in EU enjoy a glut in affordable tech talent: Adyen, Databricks, ASML. Especially Adyen is notable for keeping its cost at bay.

For reasons I can only speculate about, tech salaries in the EU have not caught up, which forces many enterprising engineers into contracting to receive a more competitive paycheck.

What can you do to build a high performance team in the EU if you're not a startup?

Two strategies: 
work with less enterprising engineers by padding teams with supporting roles. 
work with global contractors
