# Building a Top Tech Team in the EU

Often-heard complaints about software engineers are that they:
- lack initiative
- focus on things that do not make the company money
- miss the bigger picture

The ideal engineer, however:
- understands what you care about intuitively
- does not waste time
- knows when to build something quick and when to build something well

Unfortunately for you, there are endless opportunities for these profiles. 

To understand where to find enterprising engineers it's informative to take their perspective. 
You're a capable engineer born in the EU and you want to be rewarded for your talent. What do you do?
1. Move to the US. 
1. Start a business or join a high-tech startup
1. Go contracting


There are key differences between the US and EU:
1. there is much more startup activity in the US, part of which can be attributed to a better tax and funding climate
1. because of stellar growth in the tech sector over the past two decades, software engineering salaries have reached record highs

The succesful tech startups in EU enjoy a glut in affordable tech talent: Adyen, Databricks, ASML. Especially Adyen is notable for keeping its cost at bay.

For reasons I can only speculate about, tech salaries in the EU have not caught up, which forces many enterprising engineers into contracting to receive a more competitive paycheck.

What can you do to build a high performance team in the EU if you're not a startup?

Two strategies: 
work with less enterprising engineers by padding teams with supporting roles. 
work with global contractors

even though I believe the above, I don't think the angle is going to work with offending a whole lot of great quality salaried engineers.
