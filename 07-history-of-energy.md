share of biomass, coal, etc as source of all heat

primary energy: 1950: 75% fossil fuels
mechanical energy provided by inanimate prime movers: 90% is human and animal muscles in 1800, 85% by 1850, 50% by 1900, 20% by 1950, 5% by 2000




Vaclav Smil is well-known for his rigorous, data-driven approach to discussing energy and its societal impacts. Here’s how he typically supports the major energy trends in "How the World Really Works" with metrics and data:

Fossil fuel dependency: Smil often uses global energy consumption data broken down by source—oil, coal, natural gas—to show the predominance of fossil fuels. He may include specific figures on the percentage of global energy supplied by fossil fuels versus renewables to illustrate the current state and historical trends.
Energy transitions are slow: To highlight the gradual pace of energy transitions, Smil might provide historical data on previous energy shifts, such as the time taken to transition from wood to coal or from coal to oil. He uses metrics like market penetration rates and the time scales over which these transitions occurred.
Renewables growth: Smil provides statistics on the installation rates of wind turbines and solar panels, as well as their increasing share in the global energy mix. He might use compound annual growth rates or percentage increases over specific periods to demonstrate the acceleration in renewable energy deployment.
Efficiency improvements: Here, Smil could use metrics such as energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) to show improvements over time. He might also refer to specific technological advancements and their impact on energy savings in various sectors.
Electrification: To discuss the trend towards electrification, Smil likely uses data on the number of electric vehicles sold, the percentage of homes and industries using electric-based heating systems, or the increase in electricity’s share of total energy consumption.
Geopolitical implications: For this point, Smil might reference data on energy resource reserves, production rates by country, and international trade flows of energy commodities. He also discusses how energy dependence influences political relationships and policy decisions.
