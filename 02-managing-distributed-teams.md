# About

I started this guide as a playbook for bootstrapped teams that can scale up all the way to more enterprise-oriented needs.

It is opiniated on how software teams ought to operate.
The tenets underpin a philosophy of collaboration that tries to do two things:
- create a merit-based, inclusive team dynamic
- measure performance in terms of the functional value of code in production

To contain the scope, everything that happens on the borders of the team is excluded, eg:
- sourcing talent
- contract management
- monitoring user behavior
- managing stakeholders

## Merit

I think of merit-based hiring in terms of a well-functioning market of skills.
The best way to assess if someone is adequate at the job is to see them do the job. In software, there is often a long onboarding time before someone familiarizes themselves with the technology. This makes it expensive for all parties involved to take this approach.

As team leaders we can take steps to:
- make onboarding as smooth as possible
- let go of people respectfully and quickly

If all organisations would take this approach, it's a good deal for individual contributors: there are fewer tedious hiring procedures so it is easy to land a new opportunity if this one doesn't work out.

## Code in Production

I've been a part of two software teams that took opposite approaches. Team A took the office-based model and implemented it online. The overhead in terms of alignment meetings somehow increased: a large part of consensus building could no longer take place at the coffee machine so people felt that this is a good time to meet more often. The upside of this approach was a fairly pleasant work environment.

Team B took a different approach: hold the minimal amount of recurring meetings (roughly 6 hours per week) and do absolutely nothing to 'build' the team. All other communication took place asynchronously. If the need for alignment, knowledge-sharing or collaborative problem solving arises, an ad-hoc call would be arranged.

On all relevant metrics, team B outperformed team A, particularly:
- high velocity
- low churn
- good work-life balance

It is notoriously difficult to measure team productivity but until the definitive research comes out, I'm confident that a culture of shipping and minimal overhead is the way to go.

Tenets:
- Everything as version controlled Markdown
- Document how institutional knowledge evolved, not just its current state
- Avoid tribal knowledge

Tenets:
- Collaborate effectively across timezones and cultures.
- Minimize meetings but enable high-bandwidth communication
- Output effectiveness over team cohesion
