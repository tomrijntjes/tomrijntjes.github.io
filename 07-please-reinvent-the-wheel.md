# Reinventing The Wheel

I've been interviewing for a new role lately and in enterprise land there seem to be two themes:
1. everybody in our sprawling organization is reinventing the wheel. We're trying to bring some standardization to their efforts.
2. software development in our organization is stifled by bureaucracy. We'd like to decentralize so it becomes possible to innovate.

Paraphrasing:
1. we want a more homogenous software landscape
2. we want a more heterogenous software landscape

This tension field is ubiquitous and I'm still trying to make sense of it. 

Here are a couple of lenses:

## Engineers versus Managers

Homogenous software landscapes are good for governance and management. It makes hiring efficient because you only need to source from a highly focused talent pool

However, the prescribed tools are an unwanted constraint for solving the engineering problem at hand. Innovation is much less rewarding.

## Language

Reinventing the wheel is so obviously stupid it is a powerful cognitive stop. OF COURSE we want people to build of each other's work, avoid double work, leverage progress, etcetera. 
However, software products are often superficially similar in reality and do not benefit much from standardization at all. One-size-fits-nobody.

I like this explanation because during interviews the hiring manager so completely embodies one of the two perspectives it's impossible to ask critical questions. 
When I ask what kind of pains come from the excessively heterogenous software landscape I get no real answer.
When I ask the same for an overly centralized landscape, the pain is often clear: we can't get anything done on time because of bureaucracy. Maybe I'm biased because this perspective favors engineers.

I realize I use the words centralized and homogenous interchangeable. Can I define them more precisely?

|              | centralized            | federated        |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| homogenous   | design by committee    | software factory |
| heterogenous | innovation and quality | creative chaos   |



## Maturity

Organizations go from startup to enterprise, where innovation is important at first but quality becomes more important later.
Most of my clients are not digital native so I'm not entirely sure about this angle.


## Disentangling Centralization

Standardizing everything is bad. Standardizing nothing is also bad. Which elements of the enterprise software stack are good candidates for standardization?

1. cyber security auditing
1. identity and access management
1. quality assurance auditing
1. master data and reference data

bad:
1. cyber security implementation
1. quality assurance implementation
1. transactional data
1. basically any technology choice
